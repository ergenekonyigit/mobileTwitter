# mobileTwitter
This extension makes your browser load twitter content from mobile.twitter.com instead of twitter.com

# How to install
- [Download repo](https://github.com/ergenekonyigit/mobileTwitter/archive/master.zip)
- Extract zip file
- Drag 'n drop folder -> Extensions page: (chrome://extensions/)

## How It Works
mobileTwitter doesn't do anything fancy. It just redirects your twitter.com requests to mobile.twitter.com.
